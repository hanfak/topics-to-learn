# Smoke Testing

* We use Smoke Tests to verify that the System is up-and-running.
* Smoke Tests target the System - they span the System and External System Stubs or External System Test Instances

## why 
* useful for confirming post deployment/release, the app is still working 
## Issues

- Can run smoke tests, but may not be possible especially for mutable workflows
  - unless there is a test user/order that can be used
