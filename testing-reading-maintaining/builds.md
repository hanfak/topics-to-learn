# Builds

- What is it?
  - A way of running all your tests
  - packaging a deployable app (ie jar, docker image)
  - Compile application, test sources, resources
  - Run any pre requirements for build or creating app ie recreating database or environment variables
  - Store app/jar and metadata on local class path (to use as library in other app)
  - Store app/jar and metadata on external repository (ie artifactory/ maven central)
  - Can have separate steps of build, ie run separate steps, run database recreate

- Types of build libraries
  -  Maven
  - Gradle
  - Ant
  - Bash scripts

- Aim
  - Should run before commiting the code changes, makes sure all tests are passing, past behviour is not breaking.
  - Can run on CI step (ie when pushed changes to repo (Github), runs the build to makes sure this the version and application that can be deployed to an environment ie prod/test)
  - Build should be as short as possible
    - Reduce amount of I/O operations locally
      - ie html output of acceptance tests is not need for local build, but for CI build (so that analysts or testers can read the documentated tests)
    - Reduce the amount of expensive objects/actions (take time to load/create)
      - ie create the server of the application only once, instead of doing for each test or test class. If using a live server, run the application at the beginning of all the tests that need it.
      - The in the app should use object pooling for expensive objects, ie database connections
    - Reduce the amount of network calls
      - tests should use a stub
        - call a mock of a  class which does the http calls
        - Call the methods via http and not over tcp/ip
        - Have another server up and running where the calls make a http/tcp/ip call to
    - Reduce the amount of database calls
      - tests should use stub ie map/array
      - Use test database, not prod (test containers)
    - Use the testing pyramid
      - There should be integration tests to check integration points are working ie database calls are working
      - End to end tests, to check the full flow
        - Have an up and running database, network calls to a stub (ie wiremock)
    - Run tests concurrently.
      - Run concurrently in the same jvm
      - Run concurrently on multiple jvms
  - Build should give quick feedback
    - Should fail fast
    - Give good feedback
      - use good testing framework with good feedback
      - logs should be enabled
  - Tests should not interfere with each other
    - Tests should not share state with each other, so can be run in parallel
