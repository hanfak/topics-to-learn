# consumer-driven contract testing

- Consumer-driven contracts are separated into a producer and consumers.
-  Consumer-driven contract testing verifies that the producer provides a contract that fulfils all consumersâ€™ expectations.
- Consumers verify that the producers still provide the structure of messages and behavior they need.

## Contract testing

- A contract describes how components communicate and interact with each other, both message formats between components (syntax) as well as behavioral expectations of components (semantics).
- You use contract testing to verify that contracts between components are honored;
  - this gives you confidence that the components are able to work together
- When you use test-specific dependent components (such as test doubles), you can also use contract testing to make sure that they honor the latest or any specific version of the contract.
