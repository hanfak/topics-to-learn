# Service-virtualization

- is also called API simulation or an API mock.
- It is the practice of replacing real dependent components with test versions created using powerful service-virtualization tools.
- Service-virtualization tools allow a simulator-like experience but with less effort from developers and testers.
- Instead of building a custom test double per dependency, off-the-shelf tools take care of the boilerplate functionality that is common across typical handwritten implementations.
- Service-virtualization tools generally offer more features than stubs or mocks, like recording requests and responses or built-in support for multiple technologies like HTTP, JMS, FTP, or gRPC.
