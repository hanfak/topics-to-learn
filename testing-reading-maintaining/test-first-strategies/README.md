## Differences

-  Acceptance Test-Driven Development is very similar to Behavioral-Driven Development. However, a key difference between them is: BDD focuses more on the behavior of the feature, whereas ATDD focuses on capturing the accurate requirements.
-  ATDD is a technique used WITHIN BDD. They are not one and the same.
