# Test Data Builders

## What
to create input data or objects for unit tests

## why
- Facilitate writing tests by allowing easy creation of inputs or expected data.
- Facilitate test maintainability by decoupling the creation of objects in tests, and isolating it in a single location (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Disseminate functional understanding in the team through the use of business terms
- Facilitate the readability of the tests by explaining only the data implied in the use case
