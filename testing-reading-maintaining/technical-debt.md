# Technical Debt

- that when it is accrued, interest must be paid on it over time. The cost of paying this interest reduces the amount of resources available that could otherwise be spent adding new features and business value.
- when there is too much Technical Debt and all effort is being spent on paying the interest, a system may have to be rewritten before new features can start to be added again.
- Slows down the ability to change software
- All software has technical debt
- technical debt accrues, if so is it done on purpose and accepted that we will have to handle the consequences


## Causes of technical debt

- Biggest cause of technical debt is delivery schedule pressure
- Unmanaged, incorrect, or chaotically changing requirements
- Junior, inexperienced, or unmotivated programmers
- Parallel development streams followed by big-bang merges
- Delayed refactoring or no refactoring
- Poor communication and collaboration
- Poor or inexperienced management

## Examples of technical debt

- Tight coupling between internal and external dependencies • Poor test coverage
- Poor quality tests
- Inconsistent code formatting styles
- Hardcoded values (“magic strings”)
- Complex or bloated methods, functions, classes, etc. • Code duplication
- Redundant or unused code
- Out of date or unsupported third party libraries
- Poor code commenting
- Missing or out-of-date documentation
- Shared global variables, statics, etc.

## Handling technical debt

- Technical debt chart on codewall
  - axes: pain and effor to fix
  - items of tech debt placed on axes
  - promote conversations
- Have a story, places todos in code base with description of tech debt and story number

## Issues with technical debt

- slows down changes in software
- developer happiness goes down, dont want to work with crap code
- Retain and recruit developers if debt is not addressed
