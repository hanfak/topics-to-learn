# Scientific Method

## What is it

- falsifiable
- dont trust experts
- science is about reverse engineering nature
- Scientific principles
  -  It is adherence to Logic and Data - gathered by impartial unbiased experiments
  - Too much focus on logic -> mathematics, theories that may not be useful
  - Too much focus on data -> mechanics, can maintain stuff, but not improve it
- Engineering is the use of science to economically change society one innovation at a time

## Why use it

- Otherwise we rely on cargo-cult, dogma, to guide out software creation
  - Faith and belief in experts, rather than the idea and the evidence that backs it up
  - personal opinions, people become biased, arguments (vi vs emacs)
  - Some one has an idea, it becomes popular, is used but no one questioned it
  - People relying on common sense, or using it as a reason
  - The term "Recommended Practice" or how to use it, should be a flag
  - Marketing to sell a product leads it to becoming the norm, being sold a magic bullet
  - What makes it worse and hard not to trust, is there is some grain of truth, some reasonable logic behind it
- Need an impartial way of finding the best way to develop software, which is unbiased, evidence based, impartial

## Use in software creation

- Idea is to use scientific method to develop hypothesis/experiments that can be tested and have evidence that they work.
- Agile
  - is about fast feedback to use improve, restart that cycle, to narrow down on what is required
- Test first
- Learning from feedback to improve
- How to make software more like Engineering
  - Demand proof
- Never trust the manual fully
  - trust the evidence - tests, source code
  - libraries that are used, should be read
  - if no source, decompile
