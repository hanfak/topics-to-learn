- Agile has led to code first rather than architect first
  - agile can focus on the short term and the user functionality, rather than consider the overall end goal or other requirements
  - led to not thinking about (trade offs) or including the non functional requirements (software requirements)
  - Trying to add, makes it harder, and thus rewrites occur
  - Or constraints (cost, legal/compliance, deadlines, staff capacity, staff exp/knowledge)
  - or principles (how we would like to build it ie styles, standards, conventions, tech) which can lead to long issues
