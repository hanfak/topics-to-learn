# Modularity

- A principle of software engineering.
- specialization of the principle of separation of concerns
- separating software into components according to functionality and responsibility


## Why?

- Strong encapsulation â€” The access-control mechanism of the Java programming language and the Java virtual machine provides no way for a component to prevent other components from accessing its internal packages. The proposed specification will allow a component to declare which of its packages are accessible by other components, and which are not.
