## Scripting language

- bash, python
- make, ansible

[Top of Page](#checklist-for-new-project)

## Architecture Style

- Monolithic
  - Might not support a flexible release cycle but doesnâ€™t need potentially fragile distributed communication.
  - Whole funcitionality can be released at once
- (micro)- services
  - Flexible, only need to deploy ones that changes
  - Smaller, and thus less code to maintain
  - distrubited so communication and infrastructure maintainance an issue
- Style, organisation
  - Clean, mvc, domain driven design, framwork??
  - Event driven (async) or synchronous??
  - Modularising and package structure??
    - Java9? OGCD? Static analysis tools
  - 12 factor app

- Integrations with internal applications
  - Do we need an adaptor?
- API Technology
  - How will it communicate with other services
  - third party apis

- Authentication
  - How will users of the application prove that they are who they claim to be? Will users be asked to provide username and password or are there additional credentials to check?
  - With a client-side single page app, you need to issue some kind of token like in OAuth or JWT, OpenID
  - In other web apps, a session id cookie may be enough.
  - Use of tls or mutual tls, checking certificates that are signed by trusted
  - Basic Auth
- Authorization
  - how will the application check what the user is allowed to do and what is prohibited?
  - On the server side, Spring Security is a framework that supports implementation of different authorization mechanisms.

## Operations Concerns

- Continuous Delivery
  - Are there automatic tasks that deploy your application to a development, staging or production environment?
  - How will these tasks be executed?
  - Will scripts or configuration files be manually created or automated using minimum info the app needs to run
  - Manual gates
    - A break to ensure the deploying to an environment is though out and everything is ready to go

    - Expectations
    - Location
    - Equipment

  - Docker is a popular choice for virtualization nowadays.
- Management of servers and applications
  - Will this be done manually by SAs ?
  - Will be done using kubernetes ?
  - Will it be on the cloud?
- Service Registry
  - When building a (Micro-)Service Architecture, you may need a central registry for your services so that they find each other
  - Service mesh
    - istio, consul
- Database Operations
  - What are the requirements towards the database?
  - Does it need to support hot failover and / or load balancing between database instance?
  - Does it need online backup?
  - What is the deletion process?
- Central Log Server
  - Especially in a distributed architecture with many deployment units, but also in a monolithic application (which also should have at least two instances running), a central log server may make bug hunting easier.
  - The Elastic Stack (Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana) is popular
- Monitoring
  - How is the health of the server instances monitored and alarmed (Icinga may be a fitting tool)?
  - Who will be alarmed?
  - Should there be a central dashboard where all kinds of metrics like thoughput etc. are measured (Prometheus + Grafana may be the tools of choice).
  - How will be supporting the releases? Timetabling?
- Load Balancing
  - How will the load on the application be balanced between multiple instances of the software?
  - Is there a hardware load balancer?
  - Does it have to support sticky sessions?

## Development Concerns

- IDE
  - Whatâ€™s the policy on using IDEâ€™s? licence costs
  - Is each developer allowed to use his/her IDE of choice?
  - Making a specific IDE mandatory may reduce costs for providing several parallel solutions while letting each developer use his favorite IDE may reduce training costs.
  - plugins 
    - custom made, free, paid
    - legal usage
  - Mastery, shorcuts 
  - e.g. Intellij, eclipse
- Build Tool
  - Which tool will do the building?
  - Both Maven and Gradle are popular choices
  - Old school is Ant
  - Or do manual using make files and bash scripts
- Version Control
  - Where will the source code be hosted?
    - Gitlabs (internal) or github (external)
  - Secruity
    - access to view and upload/push
    - secrets hidden/encrypted
  - Git is quickly becoming the de-facto standard, but Subversion has a better learning curve.

  - Any metrics from Production
  - Calendars/events or reminders
  - Equipment - monitor and box (pc/raspberry pi)
    - location - visable

  - binary from CI is not the same as deployed version
  - Each CI build has continous build to deployment
- Documentation
  - Which parts of the application should be documented how?
  - What information should be documented in a wiki like Confluence?
  - what should be put into Word documents?
  - If there is a chance, use a markup format like Markdown ord AsciiDoc instead of Word.

## Front end concerns

- Frontend Technology
  - Is the application required to be hosted centrally as a web application or should it be a fat client?
  - If a web application, will it be a client-side single page app (use Angular) or static web page
  - if a server-side web framework (I would propose using Apache Wicket or Thymeleaf / Spring MVC over frameworks like JSF or Vaadin, unless you have a very good reason).
  - If a fat client, are the requirements in favor of a Swing or JavaFX-based client or something completely different like Electron?
- Client-side Database
  - Do the clients need to store data?
  - In a web application you can use Local Storage and IndexedDB.
  - In a fat client you can use some small-footprint database like Derby.
- Peripheral Devices
  - Do the clients need access to some kind of peripheral devices like card readers, authentication dongles or any hardware that does external measurements of some sort?
  - In a fat client you may access those devices directly, in a web application you may have to provide a small client app which accesses the devices and makes their data available via a http server on localhost which can be integrated into the web app within the browser.
- Design Framework
  - How will the client app be layouted and designed?
  - In a HTML-based client, you may want to use a framework like Bootstrap.
  - For fat clients, the available technologies may differ drastically.
- Measuring Metrics
  - Are there any events (errors, client version,etc) that the client should report to a central server?
  - How will those events be communicated to the server?
- Offline Mode
  - Are the clients required to work offline?
  - Which use cases should be available offline and which not?
  - How will client side data be synchronized with the server once the client is online?
- CDNs
  - Faster access to resources ie images, music, html etc
- Libraries
  - Secure
  - Maintained with good support
  - Use open source
  - Develop internal libraries
