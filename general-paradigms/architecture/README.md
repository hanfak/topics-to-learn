# Architecture

- Architecture is the philosophy that underlies a system and defines the purpose, intent, and structure of the system
- Architecture is needed to control the infrastructure when it is designed, in use, and when it is changed
-  **An optimal software architecture is one that has maximal flexibility for change at the lowest possible cost**
  -  cost is measured in terms of certain qualities that represent a software architecture’s design and implementation
  - in addition to the cost of the infrastructure to operate it.
  - defining trait of a software quality is that it can be tangibly measured and has an impact on other qualities
- conveys two major pieces of information about software:
  - The software components that constitute a whole system to provide certain functions at the system level.
  -  How the components communicate with each other to fulfill the system functions
