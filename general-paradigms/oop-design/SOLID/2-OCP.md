# 2. Open Close Principle

- a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- it should be possible to add or change some behaviour without modifying the existing class
- Why?
  - If existing code is not being changed, but rather extended to account for new requirement, the fear of changing it is lower and the number of costly defects may be reduced.
