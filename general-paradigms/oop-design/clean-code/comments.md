# Comments

- Comments should always add value to the person reading the code.
- Comments that do not add value should be removed
  - otherwise it distracts the reader
- Should not explain what the code is doing, if it is hard to follow then need to refactor
- Should not explain the language
  - The reader should know the language
- Should explain why this decision was taken
- To come back to the code and make changes, ie todos
- If the code is going to be provided as a library to people to use as an API, or there is a need to auto-generate documentation, then XML comments may still need to be provided.
- Do not comment every line
- Comments are evil. The goal of comments is to compensate for our failure or to help express ourselves better.
  - They are always sign of failure.
- Comments get outdated as there is no good way of maintaining them.
  - People move the code but forget the comment.
  - People change the code but forget the comment, or no longer remember what it was supposed to mean.
- They are reasonable only sometimes (
  - express rationale behind choosing a certain approach, or
  - to stress out some important detail in the implementation),
  - but in general try to minimize using them.
-  Javadocs are useful, but keep them accurate.
- Misleading comment is worse than no comment
- If you write a comment, write about what is just next to it, not about the whole system around.
  - Only about what the function has control over. Otherwise it will soon become outdated, and therefore misleading.
- No point in writing sth like /* Returns the name. */ getName().
- Using HTML in comments makes them harder to be read in IDE - so where they are read the most.
- Don't comment out code. Just remove.
  - it is in version control
- Don't use closing brace comments.
- Always try to explain yourself in code.
- Use as explanation of intent.
- Use as clarification of code.
- Use as warning of consequences.
- Create method names and informative variables instead of explaining the code with comments.
- They should not be used to indicate who changed or why, for that already exists in versioning.
