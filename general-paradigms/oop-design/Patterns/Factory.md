# Factory Pattern

- The Factory pattern allows client code to delegate creation of a particular kind of object to another class (“factory”).
  - The type of the returned instance can depend on some data supplied by the client or
  - can be based on the current context or state of the application.
- The factory method does not have to have any parameters passed to it, instead it may just examine the existing state of the application to make the decision
