# Coupling

- Aim to reduce coupling between objects.
- Cannot have no coupling.

## Benefits of reducing coupling

- It make code simpler and more extensible. In the process, it provides insights on the details of the processing of a particular piece of data. It makes you learn a lot about the corresponding part of the program, both in terms of code and in terms of business features.


## Examples

- A function remains coupled with another object because it accesses its data (via getters and setters)
