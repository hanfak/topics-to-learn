## OOP Design

Writing a program to do something is the first and easy part, writing it and change it (refactoring it) with good design and knowing the trade offs is different.

The only constant in application is change. That is why the soft is in software. To make change easy/fast/efficient/cheap we need software to be designed with this in mind. Software design helps with making the software more readable/maintainable/extendable with out increasing costs or time for reading/maintaining/extending.

a lot of what writing good code is about comes down to making proper use of abstraction levels, and deciding which abstractions to put in place is the first step to a good design.

## Use of diagramming and planning

- UML
  - Sequence diagrams
    - Big picture - full process of an application
    - single flow
- Architectrual diagrams
  - team apps including 3rd party/ database/ filesystems
  - full service - all apps that provide all the services


## OO features

Using an OO programming language does not mean that you are programming in a OO style. Sometimes you will use a procedural style. Knowing the features and using them will help in taking advantage of the benefits of OO.

- Polymorpshism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- inheritence

## Design Principles

Implementing these design principles to have better code

- Use SOLID principles (See below)
- high cohesion
- low coupling
- separation of concerns
- YAGNI
- DRY
  - Avoid Duplication
- Tell, dont ask
- law of demeter
- dependency injection
- composition over inheritence
- code to interface
- inversion of control
- Let the compiler pick up on errors
  - use Generics
- Anything from effective java
- Comment on the why, not the why
- Compose method with other methods
