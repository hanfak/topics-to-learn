# Nonredundant code

- It should not repeat itself
- Costs more to maintain
  - Having to do changes in several places
- Intentional redundency is ok
  - especially for highly critical situations
  - ie 5 processes doing the same calculation and taking the best solution and checking if it was the same as the other processes.
- Unintentional redundency is bad
- Similar to duplication
- Thinking about copy and paste, and see if you can extract to another place and call it in several places
- Examples of redundency
  - state
  - behaviour
  - Relationships
  - tests
  - concepts
  - construction
  - processes, with similar steps
- redundency in code is trying to do the same thing in multiple places regardless of the way you do it
- redundency is a repetition of intent
- We are dealing with bugs and changes only once and in one location
- If I have to write the same test over and over, I have dependency issues
