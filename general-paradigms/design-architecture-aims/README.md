# Design architecture aims

Aspects of software that is engineered to have the following, although some will conflict, and thus a trade off is required. These trade offs and choices of what is a priority change and occur during the lifecycle of a system/application:

-  accessibility
-  affordability
-  compatibility
-  customizability
-  dependability
-  effectiveness
-  fault tolerance
