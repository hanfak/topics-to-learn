# Design architecture aims

Aspects of software that is engineered to have the following, although some will conflict, and thus a trade off is required. These trade offs and choices of what is a priority change and occur during the lifecycle of a system/application:

-  accessibility
-  affordability
-  compatibility
-  customizability
-  dependability
-  effectiveness
-  fault tolerance
-  integrity
-  mobility
-  portability
-  provability
-  reproducibility
-  safety
-  securability
-  sustainability
-  accountability
-  agility
-  composability
-  debugability
-  deployability
-  efficiency
-  fidelity
-  interoperability
-  modifiability
-  precision
-  recoverability
-  resilience
-  scalability

- To improve design to meet design requirements not only depends on the logic of your program, but other factors in the software stack
  - software stack from top to bottom dependencies
    - your programs
    - libraries/api
    - compilers
    - assembler
    - virtualisation
    - operating system
    - hardware
- As everything depends on hardware, improving this despite improving it's dependents can lead to better performance
  - but is an easy way out, but can be exponentially expensive for little gain after a while
  - So design needs to take to deal with other levels first, the higher levels are generally cheaper to fix or improve first
