# Design ideas

Here is a list of design ideas that software can be engineered for. These, all have a cost, and some have conflict with each other. Prioritizing this list, and implementing some of these up to a certain point, is the goal of engineering

-  accessibility
  - Software that is accessible, allows users to be able to consume the software by taking into account any impairment
    - ie make fonts larger, better contrast, voice instead of text
  - For Backend
-  affordability
  - The cost of software, its creations/maintainace/use
-  compatibility
  - The software works in different environments or programs
    - ie windows or unix, ie7 or firefox, hardware requirements
-  customizability
  - How easy it is for the user to change to suit its needs
-  dependability
-  effectiveness
-  fault tolerance
-  integrity
-  mobility
-  portability
