# ISO Quality Attributes

- https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010

## Performance efficiency
- Measure of the performance relative to the amount of resources used under known conditions
- time behaviour
  - (measure of response, processing times, and/or throughput rates)
- resource utilization
  - (amounts and types of resources used)
- capacity
  -(degree to which the maximum established limits are exceeded)

## Compatibility
- Degree to which a product, system, or component can exchange information with other products, systems, or components and/or perform its required functions while sharing the same hardware or software environment.
- coexistence
  - (can perform its required functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and resources with other products)
- interoperability
  - (degree to which two or more systems can exchange and utilize information).

## Usability
- Users can use the system effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily
for its intended purpose.
- appropriateness
recognizability
  - (users can recognize whether the software is appropriate for their needs)
- learnability
  - (how easy users can learn how to use the software)
- user error protection
  - (protection against users making errors)
- accessibility
  - (make the software available to people with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities)

## Reliability
- Degree to which a system functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time
-  maturity
  - (does the software meet the reliability needs under normal operation), availability (software is operational and accessible)
- fault tolerance
  - (does the software operate as intended despite hardware or software faults)
- recoverability
  - (can the software recover from failure by recovering any affected data and reestablish the desired state of the system

## Security
- Degree the software protects information and data so that people or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization.
- confidentiality
  - (data is accessible only to those authorized to have access)
- integrity
  - (the software prevents unauthorized access to or modification of software or data)
- nonrepudiation
  - (can actions or events be proven to have taken place)
- accountability
  - (can user actions of a user be traced)
- authenticity
  - (proving the identity of a user)

## Maintainability
- Represents the degree of effectiveness and efficiency to which developers can modify the software to improve it, correct it, or adapt it to changes in environment and/or requirements
- modularity
  - (degree to which the software is composed of discrete components)
- reusability
  - (degree to which developers can use an asset in more than one system or in building other assets)
- analyzability
  - (how easily developers can gather concrete metrics about the software)
- modifiability
  - (degree to which developers can modify the software without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality)
- testability (how easily developers and others can test the software)

## Portability
- Degree to which developers can transfer a system, product, or component from one hardware, software, or other operational or usage environment to another
- adaptability
  - (can developers effectively and efficiently adapt the software for different or evolving hardware, software, or other operational or usage environments)
- installability
  - (can the software be installed and/or uninstalled in a specified environment)
- replaceability
  - (how easily developers can replace the functionality with other software).

## Functional suitability
- Debatable whether this should be an architectural concern
- the degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions.
- Functional completeness
  - Degree to which the set of functions covers all the specified tasks and user objectives.
- Functional correctness
  - Degree to which a product or system provides the correct results with the needed degree of precision.
- Functional appropriateness
  - Degree to which the functions facilitate the accomplishment of specified tasks and objectives. +
