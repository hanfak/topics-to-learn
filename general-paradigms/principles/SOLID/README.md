# Anti or Issues

- Came from the ideas in the book: The Design of the UNIX Operating System (Bach)
  - it was discussing SOLID at a functional level - not at a system or as OOP calls it "Class Level"
- Applying these principles, can lead to more comlex code and more code to maintain
  - There is a trade off, and the need to find out when to apply these principles to get their benefits needs to be known before blindly following them.
  - This leads to overengineering, which is a big problem not only in terms of the code produced but the time spent on something that has no use instead of extra features
- These are principles, and they are not well formed, thus there are different opinions to what they mean and how they are implemented
