# Dont Repeat Yourself

- Repeating yourself, means wasting time, time that could be used to do other stuff
- DRY is about wasting time
- Areas of wasting time
  - Following an inefficient process
    - This can occur in the release cycle, the way new features are designed, sign-offs, or meetings
      - Use feedback, retros, to find out the waste and improve processes
      - automate these processes
    - Hearing we have alwasy done it, is a sign of inefficiency
  - Lack of automation
    - ie
      - deploying manually
      - compiling
      - testing
      - building
      - configuring development machines
      - provisioning servers
      - documenting APIs
    - Try to automate your builds and deployments from day one, as they will only get more complicated as you go along
  - Not invented here, also known as reinventing the wheel
    - arising from writing code before considering the reuse of existing code
    - people who enjoy implementing things that are easily available (inhouse or in open-source world)
    - Always search for libraries which do what you want
      - but make sure it can do exactly what you need, and if not it can be configured, do spikes
  - Copy/paste programming
    - Leads to errors
    - Leads to multiple places where changes need to occur
  - “I won’t need it again so let’s just hack it quickly” solutions
    - Never good if not tested
- There is always a trade off
  - sometimes better to copy and paste, and minimal changes, instead of having lots of logic
  - Time to refactor might be too long to remove duplication, and changing other code will require retesting
  - To much dry code can result in complex code and hard to understand
- Copy and Paste Programming
  - the more code you write, the more expensive it becomes to support and maintain the application
  - Both composition and inheritance are your friends in battling repetitive code
  - the use of design patterns and shared libraries.
  - web services to combat duplication on higher levels of abstraction.
    -  Instead of building the same functionality into each application you develop, it is often a good idea to create a service and reuse it across the company.
