# Simplicity

- "Simple Made Easy" - Rich Hickey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtk3HCgTa8

- The aim of software design, is simplicty.
- The tools, practices languages, libraries etc and knowledge, experiences, habits, circumstances etc can make simplicity harder or easier
- By making simplicity easier, we are likely to do it
  - if it is harder, we will avoid simplicty and make things complex
- Simplicity is what good design is
  - ie maintainability, readability, dubuggability, testability, extendability, fixability etc
  - The ideas of low coupling high cohesion -> SOLID -> patterns, all aim for simplicity
- Simplicity can never be accomplished, as requirements change, features added, bugs fixed etc, software becomes complex
  - so always looking to bring software back to being as simple as possible
- Simplicity can often fight against of needs of software requirements
  - ie performance, redundancy, distbuted etc
