# Do It Or Get Bitten In The End

- counter argument to YAGNI
- Sometimes you need to build your solution a certain way because you know from experience that it will have to meet certain conditions in the future
- itâ€™s far cheaper to fix a problem upstream in the development process than downstream
- if you know for a fact that a customer will request a feature at some point in the future, it could be cheaper and more maintainable in the long run to include it at the outset.
