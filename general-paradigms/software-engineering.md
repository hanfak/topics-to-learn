# Software Engineering

- It is different to other forms of engineering.
- It is about designing and making something that is soft, not hard.
- Soft is about easily changeable thing.
- SE make products that are soft, and apply principles, techniques, patterns and methodologies to create soft products
- Software development is not a formula to follow to the exact detail but a **recipe** open to creative interpretation of individual engineers (pairs/groups in discussion) to be adjusted according to the specific situation
   - It is not a paint by numbers job.
   - Right approach in on situation may be the wrong approach in another.
 - Generaly work in the unknown.
- Evey task is different
  - Devs think, visualise, model, embody models into code
  - Involes a lot of learning new things
  - Very hard to estimate and assure the managers you are doing the right things.
- Devs are knowledge workers
- Rely on better processes rather than more/better devs
- Devs work in the virtual/abstract domain
  - We cannot use the 5 senses
- Developing software is about making a series of the best trade offs for a given situation.
  - Understanding the implications of trade offs to help make better decisions
- Due to the internet, open source, software dev is not about creating alogorithms for everything. Instead it is about knowing about libraries and using and combining these to create your product.
