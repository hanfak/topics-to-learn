# Clean Code

- This a controversial topic. As is opinionated and no set standard.
  - Depends on the cirucmstances of the code
    - Type of codebase
    - Industry
    - current practices
    - etc
- This should be enforced from a teams/department perspective for short and long term needs, defined and refined by the most experienced and respected developers.
  - And part of code reviews, and pairing.
  - Used in static analysis tests
  - Shared via learnings, brown bags etc
  - Part of assessment for promotions
  - Should have must do and could do parts
- Probably never achieve

## Clean code - Bob Martin

- A book of high repute, espousing many opinionated standards for writing clean code
- Giving to many new junior devs
  - Good standards to start off with, but must make sure they fit in with the current clean code patterns already in use
  - Eventually, deciding its trade offs and when to or not use 
- A people take it as gospal, rather than using it as ideas with trade offs
  - This happens due to the popularity of the author rather than content
- clean code can be different for different codebases, different companies etc
