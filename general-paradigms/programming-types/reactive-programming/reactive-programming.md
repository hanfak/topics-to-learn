- Reactive programming have advantages when you work with asynchronous data streams.
- when you are working with streams of data and you want to do operations on them in a simple and effective manner which you can run on your preferred thread.
- raises the level of abstraction of your code so you can focus on the interdependence of events that define the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation details. Code in RP will likely be more concise.
- apps that are highly interactive with a multitude of UI events related to data events.
