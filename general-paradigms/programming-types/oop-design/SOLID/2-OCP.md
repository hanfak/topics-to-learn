# 2. Open Close Principle

- a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- it should be possible to add or change some behaviour without modifying the existing class
- Good architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made
-  Any time we create code with the intent to extend it in the future without the need to modify it we should apply OCP
- Why?
  - If existing code is not being changed, but rather extended to account for new requirement, the fear of changing it is lower and the number of costly defects may be reduced.
  - allows us to leave more options available and delay decisions about the details
  - reduces the need to change existing code
  - to increase flexibility of your software and make future changes cheaper
  -  By allowing parts of the solution to change independently, you reduce the scope of changes necessary
