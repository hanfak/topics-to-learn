# Issues with object oriented code

- The biggest failing of applied object-oriented programming hasbeen the belief that you should faithfully reproduce your domain model in code.
- In reality, a few core type definitions are useful for encapsulation and understanding, but tuples, sets, arrays, and so forth are all we need the rest of the time.
- Unnecessary classes become a burden as the code evolves.
