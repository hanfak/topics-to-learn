# inheritance

- The theory behind inheritance is that the world is best represented by a hierarchy
  - this hierarchy will help with code reuse

## Why bad?

- leads to more brittle systems and defects
  - told to favour composition over inheritance as getting inheritance correct is difficult
- A lot of patterns were created to overcome the usage of inheritance
