# CLEAN design

- An object should have
  - Well defined characteristics
  - focused responsibilities
  - hidden implementation
  - In charge of it's state
  - Defined only once
- CLEAN stands for
  - Cohesive
  - Loosely Coupled
  - Encapsulated
  - Assertive
  - Non redundent
- Code quality is about keeping the relationship between objects intentional and clear
- Best code is written thinking about the programmers that come after.
  -  We aren’t supposed to create things that stand the test of time, just the test of profit
    -  Doing something that lasts forever at the first go is so expensive that it isn’t worth it, but focusing only on short-term profit will create code that collapses under its own weight.
  - Need a middle ground
  -  to take the existing codebase and slowly reshape it to make it manageable again
