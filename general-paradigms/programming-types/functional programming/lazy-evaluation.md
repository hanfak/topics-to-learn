# Lazy Evaluation

- An ‘eagerly’ evaluated sequence generates all its values immediately on creation
- A Lazy evaluated sequence, values are only generated when they are requested (on demand)
  - Java Stream.iterate and the C# yield loop
  -  It is this deferred execution that enables the pretence of infinite sequences.
