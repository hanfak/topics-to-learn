# Referential transparency

-  it implies that functions consistently yield the same results given the same input, irrespective of where and when they are invoked.
  -  That is, function evaluation depends less—ideally, not at all—on the side effects of mutable state
-  This is a property of immutability
  -  we get an object and we expect it not to change
