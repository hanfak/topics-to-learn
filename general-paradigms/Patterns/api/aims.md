# Aims of API designs

- List of aims for apis, some of these are at odds with each other:
  - intuitive
  - understandable
  - learnable
  - discoverable
  - consistent
    - method arguments
    - method names - should make sense
  - self defensive
  - concise
  - easy to use
  - minimal
  - orthogonal
  - idiomatic
  - flexible
  - evolvable
  - well documented
    - The api should not require to the docs to be read first to be able to use it
    - Docs should not be what or how it does, the signature and method body will tell you that
      - this increases the bloatness of code base
    - Say why
      - why was the choice made to do it this way if it is not obvious
    - Examples of what to put in
      - Give preconditions
      - postconditions
      - ranges of input
      - what happens when illegal values are added etc ie exceptions
      - Any side effects
      - Thread safe or not
    - Without can lead to question marks from users
  - right level of abstraction
  - correct use of type system
  - limited number of entry points
  - respect principle of least astonishment
    - Example of breaking this is Optional.of and ofNullable

- If in doubt, leave it out
  - otherwise
    - can create 100s hour of support
    - bloat software
    - confuse users
    - become burden
    - prevent future improvements
  - "it's easy to build" is not a good reason to add it
  - Have to understand that it impacts and works with other features, and is used by others
