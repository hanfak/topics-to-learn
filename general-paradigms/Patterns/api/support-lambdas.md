# Support Lambdas

-  allowing the input to accept a interface of multiple abstract methods, then you will need to use an annoynmous abstract class or new up a class elsewhere.
  - more verbose
- Instead allow inputs to accept lambdas, use inputs having interfaces of one method
- Instead of using your own custom functional interfaces, use the ones supplied by the library
  - Function, BiFunction, Predicate etc
