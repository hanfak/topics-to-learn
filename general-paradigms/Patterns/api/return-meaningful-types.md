- Example: Map<String, Map<PhoneType, String>> is hard to understanding
  - could infer from body, docs, method name but add more verbosity
  - use a simpler return type ie PhoneBook
- This is a form of primitive obsession
  - writers want to stick with using only primitives, or base types
- Having complex types can lead to problems with having to change this return type
  - Encapsulating this will be better, allows for easier chagnes
- This example is solved by making Collections first class
  - Wrapping the collection in class
  - avoids pass around complex or hard to understand collections with primitives
  - Behaviours which are not part of collections api are encapsulated and can have complex uses of api as an encapsulated method
