# Patterns

## What

- Patterns are just a common solution, to a common problem using a ubiquitous language
  - ease to describe and discuss them
  - patterns can be the same, but be different in terms of their aims
- Patterns occurs not just object oriented code, but in other areas see Types of patterns
  - patterns can language specific, ie see effective java by Bloc
- In essence, they are used to make code more changeable.
- Depending on the language used, or libraries, or tech, these will either implement these patterns (fill in the gaps) or make them redundant

## Issues

- people can be over eager, in implementing patterns, when they are not needed
- Only use them if they improve some aspect (NFR) which is needed
- patterns over usage can increase complexity for no reason
