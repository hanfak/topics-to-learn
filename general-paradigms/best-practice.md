# Best Practice 

- There are lot of ideas out there about best practice 
- They all have pros and cons 
- They all have specific usecase, some more general 


## Issues 

- Many are stated as rules, something that must follow
  - All are a just a lot of opinions, that have been used and works in some cases but not in others
- Most are anecdotal, no statistics to back it up 
- Some may contradict themselves 
- Some may fight the others 
- Can be the easiest thing to do, to seem like doing something or improving something but might not be the right thing to do
- They can get in the way of delivering value now and in the future
- Applying something badly is worse than applying it at all
- donâ€™t have a regulating body to do this for us, which leads to these practices being insufficiently defined, applied inappropriately, and cherry picked.
- There is a lot of information (some good, some bad)
  - Learning them is easiest
  - Applying them is easy
  - knowing when to use or adapt is harder
    - takes experience, seen the situation and consequences
- knowing when to use is the hardest 
   

## How to use 

- Need to think about them 
- know the trade offs 
- For juniors, better to follow the best practice, and let more senior devs guide you for the exception
  - better than just creating crap code
