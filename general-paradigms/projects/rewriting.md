## Costs

- Something that works, is battle tested, a new app is not and issues/bugs will occur
- The cost of creating it
  - Always some issue that affects the new project which did not affect the old
  - other users cannot change
- The cost of testing current functionality
- The cost of maintaining two code bases
  - Always catch up
- The current app will have logic which may not be documeneted (test/docs) which may be forgotten in new app
- Takes more time than you think
