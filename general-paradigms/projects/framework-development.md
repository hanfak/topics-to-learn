# Framework Development

- A different set of implementation patterns ot app dev.
- The change to the economics of development from being dominated by the cost of understanding code to being dominated by the cost of upgrading client code calls for a substantial shift of both practices and values
-  simplicity, the prime directive in application development, has lower priority than the need to remain free to further grow the framework.
-  to ensure that clients can extend the framework to solve the remainder of their problems
  -  But too much flexibility leads to complexity, harder to learn to use
-  goal to meet the common needs of my users but not all their unique needs
