# Naming

This is one of the hardest parts of developing software

## Methods 

- Say what it does 
- What is the outcome
- Why should I call it 
- Dont describe what it does
  - leaks abstraction, thus makes it hard to change

## Variables 

- Say what it contains 
- Why would I access it 
- Tells us what not to write to the variable
- Dont say what type it is or what it is made of
