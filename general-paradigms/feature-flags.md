# Feature Flags/toggle

- Pattern that allows ease of working with master/trunk based development and allowing continous integration
- Provide us with a mechanism to selectively enable and disable features without requiring a production code deployment
- When several stories are in play, and one story needs to be release, but anout story is still in development (has not been tested and code shouldnt be in the release).
  - We get around this problem by using a feature flag.
  - This allows the first story to be released while the other stories that are still in development can continue to be worked on.
- Other areas a feature flag can be used for,
  - are a/b testing - can turn on the flag for different production environments which will cater for select customers
  - When the feature needs to be roled out to all users, it can be turned with just a property change and no code changes, thus no QA
  - Allow for easy roll back
    - ie new version of downstream api is being used, after release the new api has issues. Release team can then do an immediate release with changed toggle or use dynamic properties to go back to using the old api
  - A feature is being created, but it realies on a service not createdy, yet. Can use toggle, to turn off feature, but release it. When new service is ready can turn on toggle and start to consume the service
- A feature flag or toggle, is a property (in some property/config file).
  - The code changes which might affect the user is placed in an `if` statement. So only when the toggle is turned on, then the code will be implemented
  - The toggle in config could be true/false, yes/no, etc
  - We can set the method to get the feature flag property to have a default, in case this was missing from the property file.
  - The code that is implemented under the feature flag, does not have to be the whole code that was added.
    - The processing can still be kept, but the return value of the output will be under the feature flag
- Acceptance tests should test should have cases with toggle on and off.
- Testing should also be done to see toggle can be turned on and off
