# Senior Dev capabilities

- Understand the in and outs of the language (not just frameworks);
- Understand everything about the framework they use and this includes:
  - Development and release process;
  - Known bugs;
  - They should have, at least once, made a PR with a bug fix to that repo;
  - Awareness and basic understanding of competitors;
- Understand everything about the build & release process of their application;
- Understand how a backend REST api works;
- Depending on the application, they should be able to design a CI/CD pipeline
- Solid understanding of OOP principles;
- Solid understanding of Functional principles;
- Solid understanding of unit and integration testing (coverage >= 80%);
- Databases understanding, at least understand how an ORM works and know the most common DB concerns
- Doing code review and writing code every day.

## Skills

### The Ability to Deliver Bug-Free Code Quickly and Consistently

- Deliver
  – Things actually get finished, and to spec – often exceeding the spec to cover scenarios the spec writer hadn’t considered.
- Bug-Free
  – QA and customers have a very tough time finding bugs in their code. When they do, it’s usually minor and a painless and/or quick fix.
- Quickly
  - This is perception based, but generally technical and non-technical staff agreed it was “Quickly done”.
- Consistently
  - Management considered the pace of delivery predictable, which is not the same as “the same”. Management could develop a good sense of when to expect work depending on the phase of the project, volume of meetings, quality of specs, etc.


### The Inability to Be Bullshitted

- “Bullshit” comes in many flavors on a software development project:
  - Laughably incomplete, inconsistent, and/or non-existent specifications
  - Hilariously unrealistic deadlines
  - Tragically incompetent co-workers

### The Ability to Explain “Why”

- A junior engineer cannot explain why they are doing what they are doing in the way they are doing it.
- A mid-level engineer has justification for some of their actions/approaches but not all.
- A senior engineer knows exactly why they are doing everything they do, and can explain the rationale of their choices in exhaustive detail
- makes them good coaches and mentors to other members of the team.

### Complete Technology Agnosticism

- understand the technology of today is not the technology of tomorrow, and that “hot” technology never stays hot
- sophisticated method of evaluating new and old technologies that examines the technology from a wide array of angles
  - What problems does the technology solve better than other solutions?
  - Where did the technology come from?
  - What is the switch cost to, and away from, the technology assuming it is adopted?
  - How ready is the organization to adopt this technology?
  - What is the learning curve for this technology?
  - How readily can we find staff who know this technology?
  - Is there commercial support for this technology?
  - What is the anticipated life-span of this technology?
- lead them to reject “hot” technologies in favor of ones that are tried-and-true.
- to push for unproven technologies because of how well they solve a particular problem
- there is a methodology of this evaluation, not simply a desire to learn or not learn something new.


### A Process to Estimate Work

- As long as time and money are constraints for a project, work estimates will be required during the planning progress
- extremely difficult
- accuracy is not the goal of the estimate, so much as predictable margins of error.
- if you are within 30% of your estimate you are doing a good job estimating.
- senior engineer views estimates as a difficult challenge to be surmounted, and as a result will normally ask for dedicated time simply to come up with the estimates.
- will not give an off-the-cuff estimate even if their job is on the line, as they understand the dire consequences of a “guesstimate”
