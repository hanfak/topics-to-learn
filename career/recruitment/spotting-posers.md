# Spotting posers

- Part of the recruitment process is to prevent candidates who not what they say they are (completely lying or exagerating the level), before they join
- If they join and dont know what they are doing, there is a high cost to the business
- If they join but are at a lower level, then there is cost in terms of
  - over paid
  - not as effective

## Signs

- Asking them to go into details about the areas they have worked on
- Coding tests
  - stuff they would do at work
