# Handover

For some stories or apps there needs to be a handover with the stake holders and users. This is where the developing team, shows how to use the application via demo.

Alongside this is some documentation to show how it works, steps for problems, steps for doing common tasks etc.

This also give a chance to get some more feedback about how to improve the app or documentation.
