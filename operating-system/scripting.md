Simple coding and execution of bash commands. For more details see links

## Motivation and why

Common tasks that need to be executed with doing lots of commands ie automation

- start up an app, or docker container, using a specific version
- bring down an app or container
- get some stats, ie git commits for certain stories
- Small tasks that dont need to be run on java or used in production
