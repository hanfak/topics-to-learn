# Cloud Computing

- cloud computing is a kind of outsourcing of computer programs
- Using cloud computing, users are able to access software and applications from wherever they need, while it is being hosted by an outside party — in “the cloud.”
- This means that they do not have to worry about things such as storage and power, they can simply enjoy the end result.
- With cloud computing, you eliminate those headaches that come with storing your own data, because you’re not managing hardware and software 
  — that becomes the responsibility of an experienced vendor like Salesforce and AWS.
  -The shared infrastructure means it works like a utility: you only pay for what you need, upgrades are automatic, and scaling up or down is easy.
- Cloud-based apps can be up and running in days or weeks, and they cost less. With a cloud app, you just open a browser, log in, customize the app, and start using it.
- Businesses are running all kinds of apps in the cloud, like customer relationship management (CRM), HR, accounting, and much more.
- if you have to buy and manage hardware and software, what you’re looking at isn’t really cloud computing but a false cloud.
