# Scripting

## What

- A program, that does some task, which is small and simple. That does not need to be a observed. Automates some task which would take a lot of time.
- Generally some one off script, but could be used often
- Generally intended for the creator.
- tends to be a series of commands that starts, runs, and terminates. It often requires no/little human interaction
- Using written using an interpreted language like bash/python/ruby
-  a program that primarily executes linearly, rather than with lots of sequential logic or subroutines
- is rarely sold to a customer
- usually take an initial input state from the user and formulates the output based on that
- A "script" is code that acts upon some system in an external or independent manner and can be removed or disabled without disabling the system itself.


## Difference between script and application

- Application
  - is intended to be used by a customer (perhaps an internal one) and thus should include documentation and support
  - tends to be used interactively
  - Larger scale
  - geared toward providing functionality that is more refined and geared toward an end user
  -  is planned. It has multiple goals, it has multiple deliverables. There are tasks set aside at design time in advance of coding that the application must meet.
  - An application comprises multiple components and subsystems that work together to accomplish a larger goal for the user.  It will likely need to use design patterns and factorization to keep this complexity manageable.
  - generally allows the user to manipulate the state mid-execution through user interaction and reformulates output dynamically based on that.
  - are complex and robust, and designed to interact with user throughout the whole run of the program.
  - A "program" is code that constitutes a system. The program's code may be written in a modular manner, with good separation of concerns, but the code is fundamentally internal to, and a dependency of, the system itself.
