# Testing

## Smoke tests

- spring generally creates a starter app with a single spring boot test that has a context load method
- This is useful as it brings up the app, and checks for any dependency injection issues
- Can take time

## web mvc test

- To test the controller layer
  - generally mock the delegates 
  - Can inject other classes that handle any controller stuff (ie convertors, unmarshallers, exception handlers etc)
- Seen as a unit test, so should be in the same package as the controller
  - if want to move need to set the component scan to the class where the main method is
- Use of mockmvc

## Spring boot test

- To test the whole app, end to end flow
- The app is brought up, the whole object graph created and properties used
- Can use RestTemplate to send http requests to the controller and retrieve the response to assert on
- Generally slower
- Assert on what the user sees, ie responses, messages sent to queue, logs, database state etc
- Messages send or consuming

## Spring extension

- Can be used as part of junit5, to set up some configuration (prod and test) to test some part of the code base (ie several classes)
