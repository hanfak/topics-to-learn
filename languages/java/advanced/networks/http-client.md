# HTTP client

## What ??

It allows the user to code a request and execute using http protocol over tcp/ip and hit a http server (which is open to receiving a request and responds). It will get a response from the server, and the code and handle this anyway it likes.

## Use??

- It is used if program needs to send a request to a third party server (ie some api) and does something with the response.
- In testing a server, via integration test. The app runs a server, and the test need to send a request, to check the request is processed correctly by the server.

NOTE: Using a browser or postman can do this for us, if we want to do manual requests. But we will only get a response and not be able to do anything with this.
