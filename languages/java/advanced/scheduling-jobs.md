## Quartz

#### Why

- Normally the database version is used to avoid repeated executions   of a job that cannot run more than once at a certain point in time. The database is used as a lock to avoid repeated executions. It works fairly well and I think thereâ€™s nothing as good as quartz right now in the jvm space
