# Instructions

  - Expression
    - they can yield results without causing mutation.
    - Expressions work more like a chain: when one person completes a task, they hand off the item to the next person in the chain.
    - Expressions facilitate the Collection Pipeline pattern, which Martin Fowler described as a sequence of operations where one operationâ€™s collected output is fed into the next. 
  - Statements
    - Statements perform an action but do not yield any results
    - any statement that does something useful will result in a mutation of data.
    - Using statements in your code is like collaborating on a piece of work without being able to directly pass that work between team
      - The only way to share something is by placing it on a table or a shelf, where another team member can then retrieve it.
  - Ending of statements
    - ```;```
  - Order of Statements
    - procedural thinking
  - Boolean/relational operators (and/or/not)
    - <, >, >=, =< , ==, !=, object.equals(anotherObject)
  - Arithmetic/math operations
    - simple operators on primitives
    - use of libraries
      - i.e. abs, ceil
      - see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
  - Declaring and assigning Variables
  - blocks
    - initializer block
