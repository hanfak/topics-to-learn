# Data structures

- Mutable collections which allow mutation of their state in place
  - he majority of standard collections from java.util.
  - When you add or remove elements there, you get the changes at all places which keep a reference to the collection instance.
- Persistent collections are the collections, which persist their previous state when mutation operation is applied on them.
  - When you apply mutation operation on such collection, you get a new independent instance of it, with updated content.
  - Such characteristic makes them effectively immutable.
  - There are plenty different implementations of persistent collections in Java ecosystem.
  - External libraries such as Vavr
