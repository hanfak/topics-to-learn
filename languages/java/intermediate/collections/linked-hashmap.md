# LinkedHashMap

- implementation of Map interface, subclass of HashMap
- ordered
  - maintains the insertion order of elements by using a doubly linked list running through the elements.
- rely on hashCode and equals to determine uniquekeys.
- not as costly as the usage of a TreeMap.
- neither the insertion order nor the access order will matter to the users of a Map
- Very rare cases to use this collection
