# Interfaces


## What

is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement.

A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method.

You can use interfaces in Java as a way to achieve polymorphism.

Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented. A class that implements an interface must implement all of the non-default methods described in the interface, or be an abstract class.

Object references in Java may be specified to be of an interface type; in each case, they must either be null, or be bound to an object that implements the interface.
