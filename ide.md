# IDE - Intellij

I exclusively use Intellij as an IDE for developing code with either java, javascript, bash, sql and scala. It has many plugins that help with development and lots of shortcuts to help develop and refactor code effectively.

## Shortcuts

There are loads of shortcuts (See link below for a list) but that will be a waste of time writing them instead here are few areas that should be learned to be an efficient developer.

A great way to practise, is to not use the mouse when developing

ctrl + shift + a gives a search for all actions best command to know and use often

- Moving around project files and within file
- Refactoring
- copy,cut, paste, highlighting, find, replace
  - globally, files or in individual Files
- Moving between windows
- Running tests and Builds
- Debugging
- Version control
- Book marking files
- multi line selection

### Links

- Code golf

I also have editor tabs turned off

## Setup/preferences

## Plugins

## Scratch Files

## Other IDEs

- Eclipse
- Netbeans

I would avoid using text editors such as atom/sublime as these will slow down work as compliation does not happen straight away.
