# von neumann machine

- His EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) is close to how  computers are used
- four parts:
  - memory
    - where instructions and data are stored
  - control unit
    - interprets instructions while coordinating other units
  - arithmetic logic unit
    - performs arithmetic and logical operations
  - input/output
    - provides the interface with users
    - an accumulator interact with control unit and input/output
- Main feature is **stored program**
  - before all computers were built with fixed programs, much like today’s desktop calculators that cannot run other software
  - Stored program was a giant jump in making machine hardware be independent of software programs that can run on it.
  - A separation of hardware from software
- There is latency associated with data transfer between CPU and memory
  - To improve computing efficiency, today’s computers **add more and more cache between CPU and main memory.**
  - Caching at the chip level
