# Zeus Machine

- freely programmable, which means that they should be able to read an arbitrary meaningful sequence of instructions from a punch tape.
- work in the binary number system, because he wanted to construct his computers using binary switching elements.
- the numbers be represented in a binary form, but the whole logic of the machine should work using a binary switching mechanism (0â€“1 principle).
- designed a high-performance binary floating point unit in the semilogarithmic representation
  - which allowed him to calculate very small and very big numbers with sufficient precision
- implemented a high-performance adder with a one-step carry-ahead and precise arithmetic exceptions handling
