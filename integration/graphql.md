# Graphql

- the client determines what data they want, how they want it, and in what format they want it in.


## Advantages

- it typically delivers the smallest possible request.
- Avoids issues that REST have, where the client might need to make multiple requests
- Standardised language to do the communication, like sql style

## Disadvantages

- As this turns multiple request into one request, the complexity is moved to the database (or cache), which can overload the db

## Uses

- GraphQL can be more useful in specific use cases where a needed data type is well-defined, and a low data package is preferred.
