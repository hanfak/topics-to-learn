# Integration

- How applications communicate between each other to provide functionality for each other
- Examples
  - Program to program over a network using protocols like
    - telnet
    - ftp
    - http
    - grpc
    - rest
    - soap
  - Libraries
    - your program calls the code of another program which shares the same class path on the same machine via an interface (api)
- Databases, files are systems for data storage and retrieval
  - You can use this as an intermediary to pass instructions between other programs, but this is rarely used now but still exists
  - Normally used for storing, retrieval, searching, and changing data
