# Deployments

- stage of the software development lifecycle
- involves the process of making a software application or system available and operational on a specific environment or infrastructure. 
- It typically includes tasks such as installing, configuring, and running the software on servers, cloud platforms, or other computing environments. 
- Deployment focuses on the technical aspects of getting the software up and running.
- During deployment, developers and operations teams work together to ensure that the application is properly installed, the necessary dependencies are satisfied, and the system is ready to serve end users. 
- Deployments can be performed multiple times during the development cycle, particularly during iterative development and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Stages 

- Planning: 
  - defining the deployment strategy, including determining the target environment, infrastructure requirements, and deployment timeline. 
  - It may also involve coordinating with different teams, such as development, operations, and testing, to align on the deployment plan.
- Building and Packaging: 
  - the software application is built, compiled, and packaged into a distributable format. 
  - tasks such as code compilation, asset generation, and creating executable files or containers.
  - Can be done before deployment (ie as part of a CI)
- Configuration and Environment Setup:
  - The deployment environment, including servers, databases, networking, and other infrastructure components, is prepared and configured to support the software application. 
  - includes setting up 
    - appropriate configurations
    - installing dependencies
    - ensuring compatibility between the application and the environment
- Testing: 
  - Can be optional, if done before
    - ie as part of CI, all parts are tested and an artifact is produced and versioned which will be the candidate to be deployed
  - Before deploying the software to production, it is crucial to perform testing to verify its functionality, performance, and stability.
  - This can involve various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). 
  - Testing helps identify and resolve any issues or bugs that may impact the deployment.
- Deployment Execution
  - involves actually deploying the software to the target environment.
  - Depending on the deployment strategy, this can be a manual or automated process.
    - Manual deployment may involve transferring files, running installation scripts, or configuring the software manually. 
    - Automated deployment often utilizes tools and frameworks like CI/CD pipelines to streamline the process, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.
- Verification and Validation: 
  - Once the software is deployed, it is important to validate that the deployment was successful and the application is functioning as expected.
  - This may involve performing 
    - additional tests
    - monitoring system behavior
    - comparing the deployed version against predefined criteria or acceptance criteria.
    - runnign a smoke test (automated or manaul)
    - checking the status page is up and passing 
    - checking logs are showing no errors
- Rollback and Recovery
  - In case any issues or unexpected problems arise during or after the deployment, having a rollback plan is important. 
  - Rollback involves reverting to a previous version or configuration to mitigate the impact of a failed deployment. 
  - Additionally, recovery plans should be in place to address any potential downtime, data loss, or service disruptions.
- Post-Deployment Activities
  - After the successful deployment, there are often additional tasks to perform,
  - updating documentation
  - notifying stakeholders about the new version
  - monitoring system performance
  - gathering feedback from end users
- These activities help ensure that the deployed software is well-maintained and any necessary improvements or bug fixes are addressed in subsequent releases.
