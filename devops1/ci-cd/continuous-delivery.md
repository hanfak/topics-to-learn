# Continuous Delivery

- CD is an approach of automating the steps of delivering code to production. From the time when a developer commits a change to when that change is deployed to production, any step that can be automated, should be
  -ie testing, change control, the process of deployment, etc.
- Aim
  - is to reduce the time and effort required to deploy code.
  - improves the repeatability and auditability of your deployment process.
    - A repeatable process is inherently less risky, which can encourage organizations to release more often and with smaller changesets
    - Automating deployments greatly improves transparency, which naturally improves auditability
      - Automated deployments can also generate reports that can also help with auditing.
      - Scripts can be stored in version control, allowing for easy review

## A whole ethos

- CD generally encompases 
  - CI
  - Trunk based development
  - pipelines
  - Developer led testing ie tdd
