# Managing dependecies

- Build tools allows project manage and import dependencies.
  - Helps with stopping conflicts with different versions and transient dependencies
- Always validate them
  - Understand the other dependencies that one dependency defined in config that will be brought in to the class path
  - check that these dependecies can be trusted
    - Do they meet requirements for app, deployment, environments, security, legal etc
  - Do not just trust them
    - They are still code
    - Most will come from open source
    - Are they being maintained?
      - ow you will need to do this?
    - How many contributors?
    - Documentation?
    - Are tests passing? Code coverage?
    - Maturity?
    - Check Issues? Are they resolved?
- Vulnerable Dependencies
  - From a security point of view, you should scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Always update version which fixes these issues
    - There should be a plugin
    - Check issues on github
  - If cannot, make sure application can replace library easily
  - This applies to code in production
