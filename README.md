# What I have to learn as a developer working on enterprise middle ware software in a multinational coorperation

This is just a list of topics that I have seen throughout my time working in my first developer role. Some of the stuff I have know before even starting my career, others I have had to learn and there are still a lot of topics which I need to learn and practise.

I normally work on backend, and hardly touch any front end stuff.

There is some sense of organisation, but it is not complete and a lot of overlap.
