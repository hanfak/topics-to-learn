# Legacy code

- what is it
  - Code that is old,
  - little/poor test coverage
    - scared to change in case of breaking it
  - worked on by many devs,
  - parts untouched,
  - lack of knowledge of code base and/or domain
  - old/mixed coding styles,
  - work on very little in the present,
  - have to fix bugs or add features once in a while
  - Use of deprecated or old tools/libraries
  - Spend lots of time dealing with upgrading dependencies
- Aim is to be able
  - to work with code base,
  - improve it when working on it
    - increase test/regression coverage
    - reduce tech debt - refactor
    - Make it nicer/easier to work with esp if going to spend a long time on it - refactor
    - Easier to add features
    - to find bugs, read and understand code
    - Share knowledge of how it works and business domain
