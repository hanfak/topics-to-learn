# Trunk based development

- all developers work on a single branch (e.g. 'main').
- 
## Why 

- Speed and Efficiency
- Greater Code Stability
- Enhanced Team Collaboration
- Improved Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) Practices
- Reduced Technical Debt
- Reduces the risk of introducing bugs
- Makes it easy to fix and deploy code quickly
- Allows asynchronous code reviews
- Allows comprehensive automated testing

## Disadvantages
- Increases the risk of bug creation since regression testing doesn't happen on every merge
- Requires developers to wait for changes to go through test processes and automated builds before merging
- Requires more manual effort to maintain the core trunk
## Barriers
- culture 
- The need for Code Review. 
- A cultural assumption that you only commit (to master/trunk) when work is complete. 
- A lack of confidence in automated tests.
