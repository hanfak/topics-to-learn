# Done

- Have a clear definition of when a story is done
  - No ifs or buts, if not done it is in progress
    - Be descriptive of what has been completed and what is left to do
    - This should be added to the jira as a todo list
  - Common things that arenâ€™t done include writing tests, documentation, and edge cases.
  - Avoid `Done Done`
