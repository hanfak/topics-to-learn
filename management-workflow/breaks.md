# Take Breaks 

- When I'm having a hard time focusing or am struggling to understand a task, that is a good indicator that I need to take a break. This one is especially hard for me since I love coding and I usually do not want to stop once I get going.
- But, I've noticed that I am more productive and effective when I take breaks every hour.
- Your brain needs time to process what it's just done. That may be the reason why we get the best ideas while in the shower or right when we are about to fall asleep.

- I use the pomodoro technique to stay focused and remind myself to take breaks.

  - Define a task that needs to be done
  - 45 minutes of focused work on that task
  - 10-minute break
  - repeat

- The general time frame is 25 minutes, but most of the time I don't want to stop at 25 minutes. Do what works for you.

- I've noticed that what I do on the break matters. 
  - If you take a 10-minute break to check your email you may be missing the point. Your brain needs to rest.
  - The best breaks I take are when I go for a short walk, meditate, or listen to calming music.
