# Task List 

- When working on a software feature it's good to plan ahead. Never jump in the deep end without a plan.
- I always have a markdown file (or jira comment) available with a prioritized list of tasks to do in the story.
  - can  pin it to my IDE so it is highly accessible.
  - Or put in engineering daybook
- The tasks I include are small and specific. 
  - Ideally, I will commit after completing each task.
- I divide the task list into 3 sections:
  - Behaviors
  - Refactorings
  - Questions
  - Other actions (include tasks not associated with the current coding ie code review, questions on email or slack, notes/ideas for other stuff)
- Whenever I see some missing behavior or refactoring opportunity I add it to the list.
- The key is to always focus on one thing at a time. When think of something, note it down for later
- The questions that build up are eventually sent to a product owner or another developer to clarify something. 
  - I like to ask a few questions at a time so I don't constantly interrupt others.
- At certain points (plan in calendar, or during break, or change of action), deal with the other actions
  - either add to calendar or handle there and then 
  - depends on urgency

## Benefits 

- it reduces context switching.
  - Context switching is when you switch tasks before completing them. As developers, I believe that context switching is unsustainable and leads to burnout. I try to be aware of this and eliminate context switching as much as possible. Stay focused on one thing at a time.

    - lose flow
    - commits become larger
    - use unnecessary brain power to start and stop tasks
