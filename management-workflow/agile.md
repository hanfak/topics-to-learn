## Overview

### The agile values

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### The principles behind agile values:

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

An organisation is agile, when it responds to threat and opportunity in ways uniquely of the moment. It is informed by history and not shackled to practices encoded in software not likely to be revised soon

Organisations are adaptable.

Prevents fortune telling
- Guess the future of a coorperative task

The manifesto had two issues
- Thinking this applied in general rather than just for writing software
- Led to only being applied to new software projects, and only until they went live

Instead of figuring everything upfront, we design, build and test little bits of software at time.
