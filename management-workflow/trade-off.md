The trade off for any project are:

- Cheap (cost effectiveness)
- Fast (time to market)
- Good (quality)
- Done

Scope that can be changed (relate to above)
- staff
- schedule

  - reduce this to meet
- scope

To meet schedule can do:
- staff
  - Add more people late, makes it delivery later
  - need more time to acclamtise
  - need to add early on
  - increases cost
- quality
  - reduce this
  - no code reviews, less testing
- Scope
  - reduce number features

  - optimisation problem
To Decide is to get feedback, data
  - Destroy hope
  - hope is project killer
  - data shows the how well the project is going, and help predicte the outcome
    - velocity charts
    - burndown charts - draw slope, predict delivery date
    - how fast you are going
  - Shows what happens when requirements change
  - data brings bad news early
    - not going to meet delivery datet
