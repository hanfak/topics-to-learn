# Unattended test

This is a test that is given to prospective applicants, who have passed the first phase of the recruitment stage, ie cv and/or phone call.


## What types

In general, it is a task either from scratch or some broken code, that must be fixed according to some instructions.

Some tasks are open ended and used to asses the level of the applicant. Other tasks are for specific levels of developers

## Marking

There should be some fixed and department wide agreed upon metric for marking the applicants test.

Work in pairs, or individual but at least two eyes on it, for some agreement.

Should get a firm yes from both, for that level.

## Feedback to the developer
