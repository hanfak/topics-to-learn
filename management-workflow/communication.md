# # Communication 

## What 

- The aim is:
  - What you want to say ends up being what they understand
- But due to the multiple paths (in control and out of control), the message gets lost, misunderstood
  - what you want to say/write -> what you say/write -> what they hear/read -> what they understood

## Why 
- This is vital in the world of software development
- A necessary skill to get good at especially if you want to:
  - Get promoted (either technical like senior/principal, or management[blah.txt](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FDownloads%2Fblah.txt) lead)
  - Be seen (Giving talks, blogging)
  - Helping other (mentoring, onboarding)
  - start up (advertising, sales, hiring)
  - Writing software (readable code, clean code)
  - influencing others
  - Networking
  - Looking for new job
  - Meetings 
  - estimations
  - Defining scope (discusisng with stakeholders)
  - Writign documentation and comments
  - Bring out responses from others
  - Code reviews
  - Build relationships

## Issues 

- What you think/believe they know or understand is different to what you know or understand

## Tips
- Understanding the Audience: Tailoring technical details based on the listener’s background helps bridge communication gaps, especially with non-technical teams.
  - what they know
  - what they want
  - How technical to go into 
- Watch out for slang, acronyms, technical, domain terms
- Use questions, to clarify, repeat
- Repeat, and repeat in different mediums
- Ensure that you are talking about the same thing with same meaning
- Ask them to ask questions
- Use different ways and mediums ie ananlogies, pictures, charts, exampels  etc
- Be clear with your words
  - written word should be easy to scan, use formatting, no wall of text
- add humour, smile and caring (remember what they said and ask about it, use name), thank them
- Never send a single hello, write everything first
- To get response
  - target your messages 
    - if dont know,take a best guess and ask if they know someone who can help
  - explain why you need something
  - explain why you need it (ie deadliens etc)
- Answering questions
  - give the responses you want to get 
    - if you dont know give them a contact or ask that contact
  - If you dont have time, say so, give them an expectation to when you can do it
  - if it takes time, tell them
- AVoid long messages (or threads) instead do a call
  - Avoid calling straight away, write summary first
