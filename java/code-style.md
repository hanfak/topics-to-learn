# Code style

Every person/team has there own way of how to present their code. It is always good to have a consensus on this and stick to this. Even better is to have static anaylsis tools/tests which enforce this or use auto format in your IDE and set the style in the settings.

Here are some rules that I use:

- No new line after class or method declarations
- In tests, all fields, setups, teardowns should be moved to the bottom the class, so that tests are the first things you see.
