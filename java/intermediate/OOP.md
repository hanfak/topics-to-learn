## Constructors

### Default/hidden constructor
### Overlaoding
### Private constructors
### Telescoping
### Static initialization

## Fields/state

- static final
- final
- static variables

### Accessors

- Public
- Package protected (default)
- protected
- private

## Methods/behaviour

### Instance Methods

- Creating
- Calling

### Class/Static Methods

- Creating
- Calling

### Static VS Instance

### Method variables (local variables)

## Variable scope

## Pass by reference

## Object equality

## This

## Nested Classes
- member inner Class
- local inner class
- annonymous inner Class
- static nested class

## Interfaces (new file)
- methods
- overide method
  - annotation
- inherit from interfaces
- Reference types
  - polymorphism
  - cannot use concrete implementation class which has its own method with this ref type
- multiple inheritence
- Default methods
  - multiple inheritence issue


## Inheritence (new file)
- abstract class
  - abstract method
  - extending
  - difference with interface
- super Class
- sub class
- super
- No multiple inheritence
- use of final
