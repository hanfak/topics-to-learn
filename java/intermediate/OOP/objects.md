# Objects

## What are they?
- An object is a specific instance of a class.

## Object creation

```java
Dog bubbles = new Dog(2, Sex.FEMALE, "Bubbles", 10.5);
Dog rocky = new Dog(5, Sex.MALE, "Rocky", 5.9);
```

- Bubbles and Rocky are objects, they have state as defined in the brackets, which can be used by the methods/behaviour.
- Now we have instances of the class, we can use their methods.
  - We can ask bubbles and rocky to run, and they will get the message (ie method) and perform that behaviour (run that method)
