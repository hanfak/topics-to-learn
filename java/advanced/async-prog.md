# Asynchronous Programming

## Synchronous Vs Aysnc

## Within the app

## outside the app

- A User access the app, and the response/output is returned straight away without any processing being waited for.

- Processing might take longer than expected, and timeouts and wait time to long. So send an automatic reply.
  - If something goes wrong, then we inform the user some other way
