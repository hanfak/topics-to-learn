### Functions/methods
- No parameters ```String method(){...}```
- parameters
  - varags ie ```Integer method(String... x){...}```
- Overloading
  - ```String method(){...}```
  - ```String method(int a){...}```
- Instance method
- Static method
  - ```static String method() {...}```
- ```Void```
- Return type is declared
  - ```static String method() {... return ....}```
- Using the above
  - creating methods
  - using methods
    - within class
    - in different class
      - ```instance.method(1);```
    - Defining variable for storing/referencing output of method
      - ```Integer a = instance.method(1);```
      - ```Integer a = method(1);```
- variable scope
- Naming conventions
- side effects
  - Avoid using setters to alter the Instance
    - new up another instance with changed state instead
    - make fields private
  - Called Methods instead of functions as functions cannot have side effects and only effect he arguments passed to it

- CQRS
  - method should either query and return something, or do something (ie delegate to another object and its behaviour) and return void
