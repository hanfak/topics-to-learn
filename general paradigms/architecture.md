# Architecture

## Patterns

- Archetectural Patterns
  - Clean
  - hexagonal
  - ports/adapters
  - domain driven
  - layered
  - onion
  - Martin Fowler Patterns
  - Feature toggles
    - ie for new versions of api

## Used Patterns

- Avoid using frame works like Spring or Hibernate (esp use of annotations or xmls)
- Embedding web containers/servers into jar
- Have a single wiring page to new up objects (no dependency injection framework)
- Property files
- Use repository pattern, instead of hibernate, in control of how we persist data into databases
