# bash text editor - vim

I have really used vim and that was only change bash profiles, git commits, etc/hosts. If I need to do any bash scripting, I would use an IDE (ie intellij) or a text editor (ie atom).

I know there are a fair few web developers out there using vim. But as a java dev I feel learning to be highly proficient with two IDEs is probably not the best use of time. With most of my time working on a java ide being able to do some stuff with a secondary ide is helpful.
