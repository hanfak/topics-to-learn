# Aim of software

1. Does it do something useful?
2. Does it do it safely and reliably?
3. Does it do it fast enough to be useful?
4. Can it be developed, deployed, maintained, and operated at a cost acceptable for its use?

- The point is building software that is suitable for its purpose. All software is made up of compromises among competing requirements.
