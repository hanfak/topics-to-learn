# Issues with Software Engineering and Engineers 

- Working software is changed unnecessarily for a variety of reasons which lead to broken products, or lower performing (slower/less efficient)
- These reasons can be for non business cases and for superficial reasons 
  - For example 
    - To try new technologies 
    - Boredom
    - Improve something cause it is looks good 
    - do something cause it is a challenge 
    - change something cause the way it was written was not to your liking or taste 
    - rewrites for no gain for the stake holder
    - Forced to use new technologies due to management say so
- A lot of this driven via ego-driven decision-making of team members, including new CEOs, tech leads, or engineering CTOs, who feel the need to make changes to demonstrate their knowledge or expertise.
- This leads to people
  - massaging their egos
  - showing off
  - doing busy work instead of impactful work
  - doing stuff for their resume
  - Wanting to have fun rather doing things for the aim of the business

## Solution 

- the importance of targeted reasoning and objective observation when making changes to software, focusing on genuine improvements rather than cosmetic changes.
- Use a scientific/engineering approach to making changes that will bring the most benefit short and long term
- Use shared ownership
  - refer to code as ours
  - Avoid you or I, instead use we and us
  - pairing 
  - pairing in code reviews
- Psychological safety 
  - people who are scared will not take risks or feel confident to do work that is impactful or can be seen to have consequences if it does not work out 
  - look to prevent major issues from leaking out from mistakes
    - code review
    - pairing 
    - testing in different environments 
    - ease of rollbacks or config changes
    - CI/CD pipelines
- On self improvement 
  - Dont get too tied up with the code/product 
  - humility 
  - therapy
