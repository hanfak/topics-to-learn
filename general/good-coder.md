# Good coder

- This is linked to the level that you are (junior,mid,senior etc), and thus linked to how much renumeration you receive
- The more you are renumerated, the higher you are valued
  - Does not mean that you are good coder, could be you are indispensible (ie only one that knows the system, can fix things etc)
  - More money you make is dependent on how much money you bring in
- The judgement on your level is dependent on
  - the people assessing you and their perception from
    - other coders
      - colleagues and ex colleagues
      - others (from open source, conferences, forums etc)
    - the business
    - recruiters
  - Facts
    - code metrics etc
  - The experience you have
    - the systems
    - business domain
    - tech stack
