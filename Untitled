- Deep copy
- Multiple cons, to maintain backwards comp, one const uses a clock which returns the time, another injects the clock
- Method that returns a functional interface, can have the body return the lambda which returns the impl of the functional interface method

- Release to prod of butters. Failed QG, could not talk to BT.
  - Resolution:
    - Checked egress config, checked certs and keys were correct format. checked ngninx logs, did a curl to BT using link (tried variations of this), checked egress conf settings.
    - Found that a setting was set to no, but this does not exist and was not what we believed it to be. Removed it and re did release
  - Questions
    - Why did this not fail in stage? Are there different configs for stage and prod? Less strict in stage?
