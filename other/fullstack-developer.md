# Full Stack Developer

- A developer who works across all areas of a technical product (front end, middleware, databases)
- To be expert, one needs to focus in one area
- To be able to code with minimal engineering/design output, it is easy to do full stack
  - but to get into the details, the trade offs, you will need to be an expert, with lots of experience (ie things that went wrong) and knowledge (esp from working on different projects)
