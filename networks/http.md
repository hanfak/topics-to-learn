# HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

- HTTP is a protocol that is an abstraction built on top of TCP/IP.
- Implements the request-response pattern, specifically for client-server interactions.
  - A client is simply a machine or system that requests information
  - a server is the machine or system that responds with information.
  - A browser is a client, and a web-server is a server.
  - When a server requests data from another server then the first server is also a client, and the second server is the server
  - this request-response cycle has its own rules under HTTP and this standardizes how information is transmitted across the internet.
- HTTP, requests and responses have headers and bodies
- HTTP requests and responses can be thought of as messages with key-value pairs
- HTTP also comes with some "verbs" or "methods" which are commands that give you an idea of what sort of operation is intended to be performed.
  - "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE" and "PATCH" etc
