# IP - Internet Protocol

- The basic protocol that instructs us on how almost all communication across internet networks must be implemented.
- Messages over IP are often communicated in "packets",
  - which are small bundles of information (2^16 bytes).
  - Each packet has an essential structure made up of two components: the Header and the Data.
- Header
  - Contains "meta" data about the packet and its data.
  - his metadata includes information such as
    - the IP address of the source (where the packet comes from)
    - the destination IP address (destination of the packet).
- an IP Address
  - is a numeric label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
  - There are public and private IP addresses,
  - there are currently two versions.
    - IPv6 and is increasingly being adopted because IPv4 is running out out numerical addresses.
- other protocols are built on top of IP,
  - like frameworks built on languages
