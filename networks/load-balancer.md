# Load balancer

## What

- They’re the magic sauce that makes scaling horizontally possible. They route incoming requests to one of many application servers that are typically clones / mirror images of each other and send the response from the app server back to the client.
  - Any one of them should process the request the same way so it’s just a matter of distributing the requests across the set of servers so none of them are overloaded.
