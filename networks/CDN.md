# Content Delivery Network - CDN

## What

- the technology provides a way of serving assets such as static HTML, CSS, Javascript, and images over the web much faster than serving them from a single origin server.
- It works by distributing the content across many “edge” servers around the world so that users end up downloading assets from the “edge” servers instead of the origin server
